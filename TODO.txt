=== List of future changes ===
Because I keep forgetting if I don't write it down.

Miners:
    - If you can't reach the source you want to harvest, give up and try another one.
        - This should be managed by a work-assignment handler of sorts.

Haulers:
    - Should prioritise picking up dropped resources that are decaying.
    - Stop doing the 'favorite miner' thing. it doesn't work well.
        - Work could be handled by a work-assignment helper as well

Upgraders:
    - Instead of going back and forth:
        - If there's a container within range of the controller:
            - Park your ass next to it.
            - Upgrade the controller, and refuel from the container.
            - Haulers will eventually refuel the container.

Builders:
    - change repair behaviour. Don't stop fixing just because it's no longer urgent, fix it to 100%
    - walls/ramparts - take an insane amount of HP to fix.
        - exclude these from normal repair and make a separate way of doing this
    - Refueling. There has to be a better way.

Extensions:
    - find a better way to determine where to build one.
        - close to spawn? no real need.
        - close to resource? Quicker to refuel, but can cause traffic jams it seems.
        - Next to the road between spawn and resource sounds nice, if possible.

Military:
    - stop being a pacifist and start thinking about ways to f*ck sh*t up.

Containers:
    - always build one near the controller (see upgrader strat)
    - maybe build one right next to spawn (can a container refuel the spawn?)

# TotallyNotScreeps
This is totally not my reposithingy for screeps scripts. I swear!

# Bad Code Warning
**Be warned**: I am not a "Real Programmer (tm)"... At best I am a script-kiddie with delusions of grandeur.

This will be apparent in the quality of the code.  

If you found this through Googling for screeps scripts, you're welcome to it, I hope you find something of value in it.
Most of this code is based on ideas shamelessly stolen from other repositories of people who've put their screeps code online.
I've then adapted it to suit my purpose, and my limited understanding of how the code should work.

It's not been tested live yet, but seems to be reasonably stable in the simulator.
